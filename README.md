# 🛠️ Assembly to Hack Translator
This project is a Python-based tool designed to translate assembly language code into Hack machine language code. The Hack machine language is the assembly language used in the construction of the Hack platform, as described in the book "The Elements of Computing Systems" by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken.

## ⚙️ Features
* **Translation**: Converts assembly language instructions into their equivalent Hack machine language instructions.
* **Symbol Handling**: Handles symbols, labels, and variables, ensuring proper translation and addressing.
* **File Handling**: Reads assembly code from .asm files and writes translated Hack code to .hack files.
* **Usage**: Simple and intuitive interface, making it easy to translate assembly code for use with the Hack platform.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To get started with the Assembly to Hack Translator, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system (version 3.6 or higher).
3.  Run the translator script, providing the path to your assembly code file as input.
4. Check the output .hack file for the translated Hack code.

## 📝 Usage
You can use the Assembly to Hack Translator by invoking the main script and providing the path to your `.asm` code file. For example:

The translated Hack code will be saved to a same `.hack` file in the hack directory
